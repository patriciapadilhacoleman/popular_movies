Popular Movies

1. Come up with a plan - Popular Free Streaming Movies (tubitv.com)
2. Setup a development environment:
  Due to my Mac being broken, it entailed after several frustrating hours trying to install a Unix box, it required creating a dual boot setup with Ubuntu
  Installing Atom, Git, Ruby, Bundle, etc...
3. Getting the Skeleton of the Project Done(bundle gem popular_movies)
4. Plan the interface
5. "Start with the entry point - file run" -- Avi
6. Cloned the repository. Experimented with git from the command line and pushing the files upstream. Ended up cloning the repository. Setting up the commit - a, git status, git push etc.. setup
7. Changed the permissions on the executable file by using chmod +x . Added the #!/usr/bin/env ruby line to the executable file so that it knows to run Ruby when called.
